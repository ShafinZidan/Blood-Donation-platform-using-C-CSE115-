Donating blood is one of the most common ways people choose to give
back to their communities, and the demand for blood in hospitals is 
always high.
Despite the high demand and the general recognition of its importance,
only about a fourth of the people who are able to donate blood do.

Many people are not aware of just how important blood donations can 
be.Approximately one of every seven people admitted to the hospital 
need blood.
Many different people experiencing a large range of conditions 
require blood provided through donation.
Some examples of patients who may need blood are:

    -Cancer patients
    -Patients with anemia
    -mothers experiencing labor complications
    -people involved in an accident

There are several blood types, and the rarer ones are always in 
higher demand.
One of the rarest types of blood, O negative, can be given to
patients of any blood type, so donations of O negative blood are 
especially needed.

If you do not know what blood type you are, it may be helpful to find
out.
If your blood type is rare, your blood donation would be especially 
appreciated.
However, all donations – no matter the type – are always needed and 
valued.
