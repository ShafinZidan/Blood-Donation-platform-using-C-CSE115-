Blood donation is not hazardous and it proves to be a healthy habit 
that helps blood renewal.
The volume of whole blood donation is 450 ml, almost 7.5% of the 
adult blood volume.
It is compensated in a short period of time.
Eligible healthy donors (age 18 to 60 years, having Hb greater 
than 12 gm/dl, and weight above 50 kg) can donate 450 ml of blood.
Your body can replenish this volume within 24 hours.
Males can donate at every 12 weeks and females can donate at every
16 weeks if they are free from any disease.

PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN PRIOR TO BLOOD DONATION:

    -Not to donate on an empty stomach

    -A gap of 20-30 minutes is desirable for a meal

    -Good sleep on the previous night/day

    -Not to donate if you have fever or taking any antibiotic or 
     aspirin or blood thinner

    -Drink water before donation

    -Not to take alcohol 24 hours’ prior donation

    -Not to smoke half an hour after blood donation

    -Avoid vigorous exercise/playing tennis for at least 2-3 hours 
     after donation as this can cause bleeding from the site of 
     donation.
